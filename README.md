## What is Animal Crossing?
> A video game by Nintendo ;-;

Animal Crossing is a fun game by Nintendo which is where the main character (you) is brought to a deserted island. I didn't include the decorating island part since that's a little hard...

# The Game
## Fish
There are so many types of fish in animal crossing I didn't include them all. However, the 'jokes' there are all from the game itself. Also, the probability of getting each type of fish are different depending on their scarcity.
Horse Mackeral and Sea Bass are most common in the ocean, whale shark is very rare, so in the game it is too.
## Villagers
So there are like nearly 400 villagers in animal crossing. Not all of them are your starting ones, so I included some I found and some I like. If you want me to add another please tell me in the post :D Just tell me their name.
## Graphics
Hope ya like the word-art thingy! :) I just found out how to use it it's quite fun...
# Summary
Have fun playing this, I worked really hard. Please report any bugs, I'm not sure I tested *everything*.
